# Webpack-Setup-and-Starting-Point

This is just the source code from following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=339s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia). It is set up with:
* Webpack Dev Server
* HTML Webpack Plugin
* Sass Compiling
* Babel Transpiling
* Asset Resource Loaders
* Source Maps
* Cache Busting Hashes

I did not complete the working app that is finished in the tutorial because I did not want to add baggage that I would not use in future sites since this is to serve as a starting point.

## Commands
* `npm run dev` : Starts a dev server at localhost:1234 and watches the code for any changes
* `npm run build` : Builds the project to the /dist folder
